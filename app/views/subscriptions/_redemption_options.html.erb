    You've chosen to gift this subscription to

    Change your mind?
    You can

                  redeem_own_subscription_path(@subscription),
                  class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
    any time before the recipient redeems it.

  <p>
    You can send the gift directly (e.g. via WhatsApp) by sharing the link below.
    Alternatively, set (or update) the recipient's email address
    and we'll send it to them on your behalf.
