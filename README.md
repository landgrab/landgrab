LandGrab ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/landgrab/landgrab)) is an application which supports tracking areas of land
in small parcels just a few metres across.

### Features

- Set up one or more 'projects' for different interests or explorations.
- Create 'plots' of land by defining an outline on a map.
- Identify individual 3x3m square 'tiles' of land within the plot (using [What3Words](https://what3words.com/)).
- Publish rich 'posts' with updates related to specific projects, plots or tiles.
- Offer 'sponsorships' for tiles of the land with custom pricing, promo codes and payments via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
- Publish posts viewable by subscribers of specific tiles, plots, projects or even 'teams'.

### Use Cases

The potential uses for this tool could be;

- Sponsoring/buying areas of land through crowdfunding.
- Visualising information about a plot of land.
- Tracking the status of vegetation, infrastructure or land use on a plot.
